# roboArm
A simple bluetooth android application used to control a 3d printed arduino robot arm.
Current state of this project is functional but runs into crashing issues and needs significant UI imporvements.
Sends a single integer as a string to the paired bluetooth module which is handled by the ardiuno to find which direction in which to move the arm.
